the bulk of the printed parts are from the stock Mendel90, 
Y carraige modified to have the 2 extra center holes for the MK42 bed and 
hole pattern for bearing blocks rather than bearing holders. 
Also belt holders are changed out with the one from prusa.
all wires are run on the up facing side, this is the direct oposite of the org. design,
but it prevents wires getting stuck and ripped etc.
a "decent" amount of extra fixing blocks added to make it more stiff and less prone to "singing":

Z isolators by David Price
These decouple the whole X carraige from the Z axis, 
should there be ANY wobble in the threaded rods this will not
results in ringing or movement  of the nozzle.
the X axis will just rest on the isolators, but the isolators can move independant

Bed fan duct,
this concentrates the air more towards cooling of the bed after print is done:
